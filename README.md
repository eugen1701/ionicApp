# ionicApp
This repository will serve to my labs repository for the course Mobile Application (3rd year).

Erasmus App

The goal of this app is to manage the universities which have a partnership with UBB

On the home page a list with universities will be shown.
A user can add and edit universities in case there are new universities
willing to have a partnership with UBB.
A user(in our case a student or a teacher) can authenticate
in the app.
The user can send mail to any of the universities and also he can see the location
for each university on a map.
He can take photos of the universities using the app and load them in his account.
